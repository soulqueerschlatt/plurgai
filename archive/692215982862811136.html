                    <p><b>Parabond </b>: A para/parame who gains sentience and may or may not be aware they’re in a paracosm. Has autonomy over themselves and is unable to be controlled by the daydreamer. However, they live in the paracosm, unlike a system mate living in a headspace/being able to take control/etc.</p><p>A living person who resides inside a daydream/paracosm.</p><p><b>Shard-Kin (System)</b> : When the entire system is kin with someone or something, in a way that feels like everyone has a different shard of the kin. Like the kin is a puzzle, and everyone holds a different piece to it. If everyone in the system was one soul/mind/etc, that one would be kin with Blank. </p><p>Language: The system is shard-kin with ____.</p><p>Example: The entire system is kin with a dragon, because everyone holds a piece of that kin.</p><p><b>Blanket-Kin (System)</b> : When everyone in the system is kin with someone or something. Like the kin is a staple of being in your system. It doesn’t matter how strong or weak the kin is for everyone, just that it seems like everyone (or at least a <i>large</i> majority of the system is kin with it.</p><p>Language: The system is blanket-kin with ____.</p><p>Example: The entire system is felinekin, because there are lions, tigers, kittens, etc, and everyone has at least some small connection to the kin.</p><p><b>Claimfluid </b>: A person in system who’s fluid between two or more face, voice, etc claims; On any given day, they can identify more with one face over another. Fluid between established claims.</p><p><b>Claimmutare </b>: A person in system who changes claims constantly, usually when the last claim lost their luster.

Instead of fluid between claims, constantly changing to a ‘better’ and new claim.</p><p><b>Kintroject / Kintrotive</b> : A word for the grey area between Kin and Introjective. Either when you can’t tell if it’s a low level introjection or a kin, high level introjection or an ID kin, or if you can tell and it feels more in the middle, and picking one or the other doesn’t feel right. Using this word, you can use both introjective and kin language. Can also be used when you don’t have a difference between kin and introject.</p><p><b>Low Level Introjection</b> : When you’re partially an introject, and either some are stronger than others, or it feels appended to your personhood and not like it’s as strong as other parts of you. Maybe you also only feel slightly attached to your introject status, or that part of you, and it feels not as strong as other parts of you.</p><p><b>Astro</b> : Having an infinite/nearly infinite amount of system members.</p><p><b>PolyAstro</b> : A system with infinite/nearly infinite headmates, and several groups/areas (subsystems, sidesystems, layers, etc).
