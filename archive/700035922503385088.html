Also has a sort of harshness, and is a very strong gender. A sort of GenderFuck. Or a gender that feels connected to being genderless royalty and a Boy/Girl. </p><p>The gender doesn’t mean you ALWAYS want to be seen as neither, but does always hold the connection to being a Prin/x, while having a binary aligned gender. It can fluctuate between wearing some unisex things to completely dressing, tucking/binding, etc to look genderless, but always crosses into the far end of wanting to be seen as no gender at least sometimes, while having a binary/aligned one.</p><figure data-orig-width="500" data-orig-height="100" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/2c18354d89641d329ca63e10a69bdb93/b059f046fda74244-8d/s540x810/abe7bf1db711a06e4ebf055c547cf0c146a7f83a.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="500" data-orig-height="100"/></figure> </div>
