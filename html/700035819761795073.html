Also has a sort of harshness, and is a very strong gender. A sort of GenderFuck, MascGirl, etc. </p><p>Or a gender that feels connected to being a Prince and a Girl. </p><p>The gender doesn’t mean you ALWAYS want to be seen as a boy, but does always hold the connection to being a Prince, while having a feminine gender. It can fluctuate between pushing away feminine presentation, to full on crossdressing and more to be seen as a boy, but always crosses into the far end of wanting to be seen as a boy at least sometimes, while not being one. </p><figure data-orig-width="500" data-orig-height="100" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/2c18354d89641d329ca63e10a69bdb93/3888da9721d81d13-b3/s540x810/dd9b475687542eda4347e95fe1cd086f666deb90.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="500" data-orig-height="100"/></figure> </div>
