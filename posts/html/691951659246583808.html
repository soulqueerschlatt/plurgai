The system could also be a system that is still part of the void, and gains people from the Void.</p><p>B) A system whose origin is too hard to explain, so it simply Came From The Void, nothing more to it. A system whose origin canâ€™t really be easily explained, or explained at all, to people outside of the system, so it just Came From The Void.</p><figure data-orig-width="500" data-orig-height="100" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/2c18354d89641d329ca63e10a69bdb93/87c9917b82c0a769-74/s540x810/9cbd459a5ffe38ae4c2617526b61b0aeb64c047e.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="500" data-orig-height="100"/></figure> </div>
