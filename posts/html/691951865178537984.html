This does not always mean DID/OSDD etc (but it could), and it doesn&rsquo;t mean only childhood trauma. It can affect structure or members. This means that trauma has affected the way the system exists, but it isn’t necessarily an ‘origin’.</p><p>Most traumagenic systems are traumabased, but not all traumabased plurals are traumagenic. For example, a protogenic system that gained most of its members through trauma may identify as traumabased, as their adverse experiences modified their structure and function, but was not caused by trauma.</p><figure data-orig-width="500" data-orig-height="100" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/2c18354d89641d329ca63e10a69bdb93/a754c321d451a0f2-3d/s540x810/8110996e53747acca7d84537b484138530b6a6ea.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="500" data-orig-height="100"/></figure> </div>
